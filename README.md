# WOAH-FMD-dataset
I created a small project cleaning and analysing foot and mouth disease data from a public dataset that I retrieved from the 'World Organisation of Animal Health'.

I was specifically interested in visualising time-series trends, performing regression analyses, and plotting country data on choropleth maps.
