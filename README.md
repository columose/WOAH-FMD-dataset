* Datasets: raw, cleaned, grouped

## Summary
* The dataset was heavily dominated by FMD incidents in Africa and Asia.
* Culling appears to be the preferred method to prevent the spread of FMD outbreaks in Europe.
* Additional data is required to perform regression analyses on worlwide data (e.g. healthy flock count).

## Objectives
Analyse FMD dataset to explore regional trends over time, determine the efficacy of vaccinations on case and death count, and eluciate the most effective methods for dealing with FMD outbreaks.

## Methods
* Dataset cleaning.
* Descriptive statistics.
* Time-series analysis of countries grouped by world region.
* Plotting outliers.
* Baselining count data to detect trends in world regions with fewer counts accross variables.
* Correlation matrices within world regions to explore relationships between variables.
* Post-hoc regression analysis to determine whether 'cases' in Europe can predict 'killed and disposed of' (culling).
* Create choropleth maps for each FMD variable to understand trends between neighbouring countries.
* Cluster analysis to group related variables (e.g. New outbreaks, Cases, Deaths), and plot on a choropleth map.

## Overview of the dataset
The majority of FMD outbreaks and cases occurred in Africa and Asia, with as few as 3 European countries reporting outbreaks since 2005.
